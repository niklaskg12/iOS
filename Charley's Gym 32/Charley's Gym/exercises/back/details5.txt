Chin-ups: hang on the bar with straight arms and your palms facing you. Pull yourself up until the chin passes the bar. Form on Pull-ups is the same except palms facing away from you. To do Pull-ups with proper form, hang on the pull-up bar with straight arms and your palms facing away. Pull yourself up until your chin pass the bar. Lower yourself all the way down until your arms are straight, then repeat. Chin-ups are like Pull-ups except you grip the bar with your palms facing you. Chin-ups are easier than Pul-ups because they work your biceps more. Pull-ups with palm facing away are harder because they take your biceps out of the movement. Less muscles work means less strength.
