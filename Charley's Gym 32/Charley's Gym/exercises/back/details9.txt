1.    For this exercise you will need an incline bench, or alternatively you can prop up one end of a straight bench. Grab dumbbells and set them at the high end of the bench.
2.    Lay face down on the bench so that your chest is at the end of the bench.
3.    Your feet can either hang off the end of the bench or be placed on the floor on either side of the bench for stability.
4.    Grasp the dumbbells with an overhand grip (palms facing you) and raise the dumbbells off the floor slightly.
5.    Keep your head up and your eyes looking forward, and then slowly raise the dumbbells up as far as possible.
6.    Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement, and then lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
7.    Repeat for desired reps.
