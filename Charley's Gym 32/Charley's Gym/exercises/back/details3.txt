1.    If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a pull-up assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. As a third option you can perform this exercise using the bar of a smith machine and you can self spot yourself using your feet. Only if none of these options are available, then substitute the exercise by a close reverse pull-down.

2.    More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.

3.    It is important that you lean back (around 30-degrees) and stick your chest out as you perform this exercise since performing it with the torso straight (at a 90-degree angle in relation to the floor) will mainly emphasize the biceps.

4.    Avoid swinging as you perform the movement.
