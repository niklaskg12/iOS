1.) Start off by attaching a stirrup bar to a low cable pulley and standing on the side of the weight stack with your legs shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent.

2.) Grasp the stirrup in one hand with an underhand grip (palms facing up) and lower the stirrup to the top of your thighs.

3.) Keeping your elbows still, curl the stirrup up towards your chest, squeezing and isolating the bicep muscle.

4.) Slowly lower the stirrup to the starting position.

5.) Repeat for as many reps and sets as desired
