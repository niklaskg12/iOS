1.) Start off by adjusting the seat of a preacher bench so that your arms are level with the top of the bench.

2.) Grab onto a bicep curl bar with an underhand (palms up) grip, keeping your arms shoulder-width apart, resting them against the bench, and extending them fully.

3.) While keeping your arms on the bench, slowly curl the bar up towards your head, isolating the bicep and squeezing the muscles.

4.) Hold for a count and then return back to the starting position.
