Step 1
Starting Position: Standing in a split-stance position to stabilize your body, hold a dumbbell in each hand; thumbs around the handles with your palms facing your body. Thedumbbells rest alongside your thighs with your elbows straight. Brace your torso by contracting your abdominal/core muscles. Pull your shoulder blades down and back. Your head and neck should be aligned with your spine. Do not allow the back to arch. Maintain these engagements throughout the exercise.
 

Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale. Slowly bend one or both elbows until the dumbbell(s) near(s) the front of your shoulder. If performing alternating arm curls, the opposite arm should remain in the starting position. Keep your torso erect. Do not allow the elbows to move forward. Keep the palms facing your body and your wrists straight without any bend. Do not allow the shoulders to shrug.

 

Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale. Gently straighten the elbows and lower the dumbbells back to your starting position. Keep the dumbbell in the neutral position. Maintain your split-stance, erect torso and stable shoulder position. If performing alternating arm curls, repeat to the opposite side.
As some of us show structural differences at the elbow, we may not be able to hold the dumbbells against our sides in the lowered position unless we force a bend at our wrists. The dumbbell position selected should be one that is most comfortable for you and keeps the wrists aligned straight with the forearm.
