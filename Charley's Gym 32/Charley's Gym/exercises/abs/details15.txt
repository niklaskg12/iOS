1.      Grab a decline bench and set it to an angle between 30 and 45 degrees. The higher the angle the harder the exercise will be.
2.      Lay down on the bench with your back at the lower end and touch the side of your head with your finger tips.
3.      Raise your shoulder blades off the bench slightly. This is the starting position for the exercise.
4.      Pulling your torso up, take your right elbow across to your left knee.
5.      Lower the torso back down.
6.      Now take your left elbow up to your right knee. This is one rep.
7.      Repeat for desired reps
