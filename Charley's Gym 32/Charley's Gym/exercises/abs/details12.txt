1.     Lie down on the floor placing your feet either under something that will not move or by having a partner hold them. Your legs should be bent at the knees.
2.     Place your hands behind your head and lock them together by clasping your fingers. This is the starting position.
3.     Elevate your upper body so that it creates an imaginary V-shape with your thighs. Breathe out when performing this part of the exercise.
4.     Once you feel the contraction for a second, lower your upper body back down to the starting position while inhaling.
5.     Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions
