Place a pair of dumbbells, slightly wider than shoulder width apart.
Set yourself in a pushup position with hands on dumbbells.
Lower your body to the floor, pause, then complete 1 push up.
Once you're back in the starting position, row the dumbbell on one side to the side of your chest by pulling the dumbbell upwards.
Pause, then lower the dumbbell back down, and repeat the same movement with your other arm.
That is the completion of 1 rep.
