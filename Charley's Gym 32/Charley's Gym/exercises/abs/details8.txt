1.)    Start off by positioning yourself on parallel bars by placing your back on the padding, forearms rested upon the arm rests and grabbing the handles in front of you.

2.) Keep your legs extended and together, then slowly elevate your feet up towards the ceiling, still keeping them together and straight.

3.) Squeeze your lower abs as much possible on the way up and go up as far as possible, hold for a count then return back to the starting position.

4.) Repeat for as many reps and sets as desired.
