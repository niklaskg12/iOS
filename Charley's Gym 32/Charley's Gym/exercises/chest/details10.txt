Preparation
Stand between two pulleys position hip height and arms width or slightly wider apart. Grasp stirrups, one in each hand. Extend arms out with elbows slightly bent, pointed back and downward slightly. Step forward until cables are taut or when weights are lifted up slightly. Stand with feet staggered.
Execution
Keeping elbows fixed in slightly bent position, bring stirrups together in upwardly arching, hugging motion, at 30? to 45? angle until they meet at top of motion. Lower stirrups to original position in reverse pattern. As soon as stretch is felt in chest or shoulders, repeat motion.
