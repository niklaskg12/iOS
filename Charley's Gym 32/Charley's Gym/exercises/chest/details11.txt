Preparation
Grasp two opposing high pulley dumbbell attachments. Stand with pulleys to each side. Bend over slightly by flexing hips and knees. Bend elbows slightly and internally rotate shoulders so elbows are back initially.
Execution
Bring cable attachments together in hugging motion with elbows in fixed position. Keep shoulders internally rotated so elbows are pointed upward at top and out to sides at bottom. Return to starting position until chest muscles are stretched. Repeat.
