1.      Set up for the dumbbell step up by choosing a pair of dumbbells and holding them down at your sides.
2.      Stand up straight in front of a flat bench or other raised platform.
3.      Keep your eyes facing forward and a slight bend in your knees. This is the starting position.
4.      Lift your left knee and step onto the platform with your left foot.
5.      Once your foot is firmly planted on the platform, use your left heel to lift your body up and place your right foot on the platform as well.

7.      Repeat this motion for desired reps and then repeat while leading with your right foot.
