Step 1 Get in there!
Step 2 Choose a heavy weight! I find you can go much heavier than you would in the traditional seated method. Start out light and work your way up if you arenâ€™t sure where to start.
Step 3 Stand up, drop it low and get to work!! Keep your back straight (not hunched), core tight and focus on using only your glutes and legs to move the weight. I typically do 3 sets of 12 at 230 or 250 lbs. I brace myself by holding onto the sides of the machine.
Step 4 Feel the burn!!
