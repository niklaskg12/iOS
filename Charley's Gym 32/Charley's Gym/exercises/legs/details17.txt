1. Stand erect holding a loaded barbell with a shoulder-width, overhand grip, feet 6-8 inches apart. Stand on a box or step if your flexibility requires.

2. Keeping your chest high, abs tight and knees slightly unlocked, bend forward at the hips, letting the bar naturally track away from your body.

3. Allow your low back to round slightly as you descend.

4. Pause when you feel a good stretch, then carefully reverse the motion by contracting your glutes and hamstrings, allowing the bar to come closer to your body only as you approach the top position.

5. Squeeze your abs, back and glutes at the top.
