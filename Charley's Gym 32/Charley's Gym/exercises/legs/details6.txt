1. Load a barbell and take a step forward with your right foot. Kick your left foot out behind your body and assume split stance. Tighten your core, draw your shoulders back, and maintain strong posture. This is your starting position.
2. While keeping your back straight and chest out, slowly lunge forward with your front leg until your quad is parallel to the floor. Stop just before your back knee touches the floor.
3. Hold for 1 second.
4. Using your butt and hamstrings, powerfully drive your front foot into the ground and ascend upward back into split stance.
5. Switch your feet and repeat the movement. Continue to alternate legs for a full set of 24 (12 per side).
6. Complete 3+ sets. Progressively increase the weight as your body gets stronger to ensure continuous growth.
