Step 1
Stand sideways to a wall with straight posture. Place your nearest hand on the wall if you need to balance yourself.
Step 2
Shift your weight to the leg nearest the wall. Inhale to prepare for exercise.
Step 3
Exhale and lift your outside leg away from your mid-line out to the side at a 45-degree angle. Inhale and slowly resist gravity as you lower your leg down to starting position. Refrain from lifting the leg higher than 45-degrees because it will tilt your pelvis, cause incorrect body mechanics, and not benefit the exercise.
Step 4
Continue to perform standing hip abductions for three sets of 10 repetitions. Rest 30 seconds between each set.
