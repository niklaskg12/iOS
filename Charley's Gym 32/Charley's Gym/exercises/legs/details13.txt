1.    Step 1: Starting Position: Hold a barbell on the back of your shoulders while standing up straight. Stand behind an elevated platform. The kind used for spotting behind a flat bench is ideal for this purpose.
2.    Step 2: Put your right foot on the elevated platform. Step on it by extending your right hip and knee. Use your heel to lift the rest of your body and place your left foot on the platform, too. Exhale while you come up.
3.    Step 3: Step down with your left leg. To do so, flex your right hip and knee while inhaling. Return to the starting position by putting your right foot next to the left one.
4.    Step 4: Repeat with your right leg for the desired number of reps and then repeat with your left leg.
