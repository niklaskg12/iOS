Step 1
Adjust the barbell so it's about shoulder height on the Smith machine.
Step 2
Load the barbell with the weight you want to use. If you're new to using the Smith machine, perform the exercise with just the weight of the bar. Once you develop proper form, add a small amount of weight and gradually increase it as you get stronger.
Step 3
Position yourself behind the bar and spread your feet hip-width apart. The bar should be slightly above the front of your shoulders, and your feet should be directly under the bar.
Step 4
Place your hands on the bar, shoulder-width apart, with your elbows bent and facing forward. Your upper arm should be parallel to the floor, and your palms should face your shoulders. Alternatively, cross your arms over each other and place them shoulder-width on top of the barbell.
Step 5
Push up through you heels and rotate the bar backward to disengage the safety hooks.
Step 6
Bend your knees and your hips, push your glutes back and slowly lower yourself straight down as if to sit in a chair. Aim to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Stop sooner if you can't maintain the natural curve in your back. Avoid looking down during the exercise -- keep your eyes straight ahead so your neck and back stay straight. Don't allow your knees to go over your toes.
Step 7
Push through your heels and straighten your legs to come back to the starting position. Keep your knees soft and immediately go into the next repetition. After completing a set, rotate the bar forward to engage the safety hooks.
