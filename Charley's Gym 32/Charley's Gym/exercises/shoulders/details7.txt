1.      Sit down on a military press bench or adjust an adjustable angle bench, setting the back to 90 degrees.
2.      Load a barbell with the appropriate weight. Ideally, you can un-rack the weight from a weight rack or have a training partner hand you the bar.
3.      Hold the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing forward) with your hands just beyond shoulder width. Your arms will now be almost fully extended above your head with a slight bend in your elbows. This is the starting position.
4.      Slowly begin lowering the bar to your upper chest - almost touching your collarbone.
5.      Pause, and then begin pushing the bar back up to the starting position.
6.      Repeat for desired reps.
