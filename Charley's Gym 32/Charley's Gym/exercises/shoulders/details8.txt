1.      The seated dumbbell press is one of the most popular mass builders for the shoulders! Set up for the exercise by getting an adjustable angle bench and setting the back to 90 degrees. 
2.      Grasp a pair of dumbbells and sit down on the bench with the ends of the dumbbells on your thighs.
3.      Raise the dumbbells above your head and twist so that your palms are facing forward. Your back should be flat against the back rest and your feet firmly planted on the floor for stability. This is the starting position for the exercise.
4.      Keeping your eyes facing forwards, slowly lower the dumbbells to the sides of your shoulders.
5.      Once they are around shoulder height, contract the shoulder muscles and raise the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6.      Do not pause at the top of the movement, and immediately begin lowering the dumbbells back down for the next rep.
7.      Repeat for desired reps.
