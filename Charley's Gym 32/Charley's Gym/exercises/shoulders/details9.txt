1.      Set the pulleys of a dual cable machine to the low setting and select the weight you wish to use.
2.      Stand facing away from the machine and grasp the left handle with your right hand, and right handle with your left hand.
3.      Stand straight up with your arms in front of you (crossed over). The weight should be slightly off the stack. This is the starting position for the movement.
4.      Keeping your elbows high, extend your arms out in a semi-circle motion.
5.      Once your hands get to around shoulder height, pause and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position.
6.      Repeat for desired reps.
