1.    Step 1: Choose a weight and grasp the handle of the low pulley with your right hand.
2.    Step 2: Bend forward from the waist; your torso should be nearly parallel with the floor. Bend your knees slightly and place your left hand on your left thigh. Let your right arm hang from your shoulder in front of you; your elbow should be slightly bent. This is the starting position.
3.    Step 3: Lift your right arm, keeping your elbow slightly bent. Keep moving your arm until it is parallel to the floor, in line with your right ear. Breathe out as you do so.
4.    Step 4: Slowly bring the weight back down to the starting position.
5.    Step 5: Repeat for the number of reps in your exercise schedule, then repeat the process with the other arm.
