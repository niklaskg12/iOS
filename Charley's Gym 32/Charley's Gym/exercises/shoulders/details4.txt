1.The cable front raise is a great exercise for isolating the front delts. Set up for the exercise by attaching a straight bar to a low pulley cable machine and selecting the weight you want to use.
2.Stand facing away from the machine and grip the straight bar with an overhand grip (palms facing down).
3.Stand up straight with your eyes forward, holding the bar just off your thighs. This is the starting position.
4.To execute, slowly raise the bar up to around shoulder height while keeping your arms straight and your body fixed.
5.Pause, and then slowly lower the bar to the starting position.
6.Do not allow the stack to drop or the bar to touch your body.
