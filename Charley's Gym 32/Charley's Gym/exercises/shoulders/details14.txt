1.) Start off standing in front of an incline bench holding a pair of dumbbells in each hand, bending slightly at your knees and keeping your abs tight.

2.) Bend over slowly until your forehead touches the top of the bench, keeping your arms handing at your sides and palms facing each other.

3.) Slowly raise your arms out to their sides, squeezing your deltoids on the ascent.

4.) Once your arms are parallel with the floor, hold for a count while squeezing your muscles then return back to the starting position.
