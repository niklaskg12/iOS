1.    Step 1: Lie down on a flat bench and hold onto the straight bar attachment of a low pulley using a narrow overhand grip.
2.    Step 2: Keeping your arms extended, bring the bar down over your torso, creating a 90-degree angle. This is the starting position.
3.    Step 3: Bend at the elbow to lower the bar, while keeping your upper arms stationary and your elbows in. Pull down until the bar makes contact with your forehead. Inhale while you perform this movement.
4.    Step 4: Flex your triceps as you raise the bar back to its starting position. Exhale while you do so.
5.    Step 5: Hold for a second in the contracted position and repeat for the number of reps in your set.
