Step 1
Warm up for the exercise by performing five to 10 minutes of light cardio activity, then do some dynamic stretches. Do 10 horizontal arm swings at shoulder height to loosen your shoulders and chest, plus 10 side bends to each side to stretch your triceps and upper back.
Step 2
Set the desired amount of weight on the assisted dip machine to counterbalance some of your body weight. Unlike most machines, the more weight you select, the easier the exercise becomes.
Step 3
Climb onto the machine by either stepping onto the resistance lever or kneeling on the resistance platform.
Step 4
Grip the parallel bars with your palms facing your body and extend your arms completely. Keep your legs straight if you’re standing on a resistance lever while doing triceps dips. Flex your knees and lean forward a bit if you’re performing assisted chest dips.
