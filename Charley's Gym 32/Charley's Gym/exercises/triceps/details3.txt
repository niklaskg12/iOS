  The close grip bench press is a good mass builder for the triceps! Set up for the exercise by loading the weight on the bar and adjusting the height of the rack (if adjustable).
  Lay back on the bench and position your feet firmly on the floor.
  Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing your feet) with your hands about 8-12 inches apart. Take the weight off the rack.
  Keeping your elbows tucked in at your sides, slowly lower the barbell down to your middle chest until it's about 1 inch from touching.
  Contract the triceps and push the barbell back up until your arms are almost fully outstretched.
  Don't lock the elbows, and then repeat the movement for desired reps.
