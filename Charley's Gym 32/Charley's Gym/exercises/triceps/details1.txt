1.       Stand before the cable apparatus and grasp the desired attachment, which in this case is the single-grip attachment, with an underhand grip (i.e. thumbs facing outward). (See "Further Clarification" for various grip attachments.)
2.       Keeping your elbows at your body's sides, press the weight downward, while exhaling throughout the movement. If desired, you may self-spot with your free hand.
3.       Slowly allow the weight to rise until your forearms are parallel to the ground, inhaling throughout the negative motion.
4.       Repeat steps 2-3 for as many sets as are desired.
