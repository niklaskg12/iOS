Step 1
Starting Position: Stand in a split-stance position holding a dumbbell with both hands wrapped around the dumbbell handle. Brace your torso by contracting your abdominal/core muscles. Pull your shoulder blades down and back. Your head and neck should be aligned with your spine. 
Maintain these engagements throughout the exercise.

 

Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale. Slowly press the dumbbell overhead. Straighten your elbows until your arms are vertical to the floor. You elbows are pointing forward and are straight but not locked. The dumbbell should be positioned directly over your head with your palms facing upwards and the dumbbell hanging vertically from your palms. Maintain your balance. Do not change the position of your head, torso, upper arms, wrists or feet.

 

Step 3
Downward Phase: Inhale. Bend your elbows in a slow and controlled manner, lowering the dumbbell behind your head. Do not allow the upper arms to move. Continue to bend the elbows to a 90 degree bend or until your upper arms begin to move backward. Do not make contact with the back of your head. Do not change the position of your head, torso, upper arms, wrists or feet. Slowly straighten the elbows and return to start position. Repeat.

Attempt to keep your upper arms vertical to the floor throughout the exercise and your elbows shoulder-width apart.
