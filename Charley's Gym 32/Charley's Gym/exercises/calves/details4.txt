1.      The smith machine is a good alternative if your gym does not have a standing calf raise machine. Set the bar on the smith machine to around shoulder height and rack up the weight you want to use.
2.      Grab a step or calf block and put it below the bar.
3.      Step up on the block and position the balls of your feet on the edge.
4.      Grasp the smith bar with a wide grip and position it across the top of your back muscles (not across the back of your neck!).
5.      Push up to take the weight off the rack and slowly let your heels drop down as far as possible. This is the starting position.
6.      Slowly raise your heels as far as you can off the floor.
7.      Squeeze the calf muscles, and then slowly lower your heels back to the starting position.
8.      Repeat for desired reps.
