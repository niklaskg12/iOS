1.    Stand on the edge of a step.

Or, if you have a step-aerobics platform, place two sets of risers underneath the platform.

2.    Stand tall with your abdominals pulled in, the balls of your feet firmly planted on the step, and your heels hanging over the edge.

Rest your hands against a wall or a sturdy object for balance.

3.    Raise your heels a few inches above the edge of the step so that you’re on your tiptoes.

4.    Hold the position for a moment, and then lower your heels below the platform, feeling a stretch in your calf muscles.
